# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

*this was one of the easier sections for me so my struggle was staying on track and not spending too much time "looking ahead" and trying to mess around and see what else you can do with objects and methods and functions*

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

*it's not a huge part of what I'm doing right now - I've found that it slows me down and when I need to refer back to something I look at the Mod0 site and instrutions, however as a student in general i am a big note taker, it's just that here it's not as productive.The most helpful notes i do take are at the very beginning of lessons where it goes overe conceptually what a thing is, and I always write down common mistakes I make to remember not to do those again*

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

*try to figure out on my own first, then googling when i get in a jam; sometimes i should jump to googling quicker*
